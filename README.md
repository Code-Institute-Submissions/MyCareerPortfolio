## MY CAREER PORTFOLIO

Welcome,

This is my personal career portfolio from the present to back to 1990, covering summary files of the work I performed for specific organisations over the years. The summary files can be accessed via the resume page, where there are 14 jpg images and onced a particular imaged is clicked-on, a specific summary page will be opened in a new window as a pdf file format.

The home page contains a bespoke jpg image, which identifies the main theme of what I am about, plus all the systems, tasks, research and inventions I have done. Text in orange are the systems I have analysed. Text in black are the Engineering tasks I have performed. Text in blue are the research areas performed. Text in purple are the published work. Lastly the text in light green is the invention I have created complete with patent achieved.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

## UX

To get to a point where coding could start I used Balsamiq Wireframes to experiment with various arrangements, see link: (https://e9b69726-707e-4f11-8b32-2169d2e7908e.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/files/download/?id=f2eedcf5-2673-4adf-bd15-75573a499e71), which in the end was loosly followed. The end result was a better arrangement to accommodate the various screen sizes from mobiles to PC screens. The design ethos was to produce a responsive web design approach.

This web site is too show what I have achieved in almost 30 years in work covering many different types of systems where the projects existed in many different countries world-wide. Show-casing my achievements and skills is for the intended marketplace of Engineering Companies, Research Establishments and Recruitment Agencies for the purpose of obtaining a new career position.

## Features

The main features allows the user to navigate easily through the web-site, which is intuitive as it is basic. The addition of having the career point summaries being provided as downloadable pdf fact sheets makes it both simple to use and useful for discussions away from a comuter terminal.

The main improvements is to replace all of the Lorem ipsum text with the real factual detailed text.

## Technologies used

At the beginning mind mapping with the KnowledgeBase Builder was used to get a feel for the requirements of the project for the strategy formulation part of the design process. This was followed by frog leaping the scope and structure process steps to produce the Wireframes using Balsamiq Wireframes tool for the skeleton plane design step.

During coding GitHub with Gitpod was used along with the use of Visual Studio Code IDE concurrently to appreciate the diiferences in how the web-site looks in the different environments.

## Testing

index.html:

The only error from this file using validator.w3.org is as follows: https://e9b69726-707e-4f11-8b32-2169d2e7908e.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/files/download/?id=26ae1c2f-3851-4544-b18c-e8159b095c23. However, I am ignoring this error as I am getting the result I want with it being in place.

experiences.html:

There are 14 errors and 1 warning in this file as shown in: https://github.com/CygnusKernow/MyCareerPortfolio/blob/9fb594b7cf127a2c551873b1af28567b1203c6c0/assets/Testing-Errors/experiences-file-errors.jpg. The 14 errors are the same as the one error in the index file. Since I am getting the result I want to provide all of these are being ignored and considered irrelevant.

style.css:

No errors present in this file:
